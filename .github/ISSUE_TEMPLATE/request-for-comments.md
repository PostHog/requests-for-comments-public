# Request for comments: TITLE & OWNER

## Problem statement

_Who are we building for, what are their needs (include example cases), why is this important?_

## Success criteria

_How do we know if this is successful (i.e. metrics, customer feedback), what's out of scope, whats makes this ambitious?_

## Context

_What are our competitors doing, what are the technical constraints, what are customers asking for, what does the data tell us, are there external motivations (e.g. launch week, enterprise contract)?_

## Design

_What are the key user experience and technical design decisions / trade-offs?_

## Sprints

_How do we break this into discrete and valuable chunks for the folks shipping it? How do we ensure it's high quality and fast?_
