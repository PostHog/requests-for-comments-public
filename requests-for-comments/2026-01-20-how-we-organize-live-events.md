# Request for comments: How we organize live events

## Concept

### Who is this event for (persona)

Define the persona of the desired participant at this event e.g. "Full stack developer with 10 YoE who uses our products at scale".

### What venue matches our energy and persona

Envision the venue prior to exploring options e.g. "Walkable and parkable, ground level access event/coworking/VC space with a projector and a stage".

### Theme

Appeal to the persona and signal the topics e.g. "Feature flags FTW w/ PostHog" for a workshops series. If the theme showcases a specific feature, consider including a call to action to signal the feature or a unique insight guests will unlock e.g. "ACE your user onboarding w/ PostHog" (for Product Tours). Try not to sound sales-y.

### Hypothesis to test

There exists an IRL network of product-minded developers in this geography that is willing to engage with our new feature, provide quality feedback and advocate for us.

### Promotion

Use [Luma](https://luma.com) as a primary sign-up platform along with [PostHog's](https://posthog.com/events) events page.
Include the event in email blasts based on geography. Ensure local event aggregators have picked it up.
Target a core guest cohort (could be a few guests to DM in advance). They will likely invite peers and be willing to engage more during the event, provide quality feedback etc. This core guest cohort will be asked to arrive slightly earlier the day of the event. As we make more connections in this geography, we can vary the core guests for subsequent events.

## Plan

### Logistics

Order food from a highly rated vendor near the venue. Physical proximity reduces unwanted delays, allows for last-minute changes etc.

Ship merch well in advance (customs are often an issue with international shipping).

Nametags are important. Preferably, guests will write their own names/company (since they may not have disclosed this upon sign up).

Keep contact with venue and food vendor leading up to the event (check-in 72hrs, 24hrs before the event).

### Layout

Have a basic layout of the space to ensure smooth flow of people, food, merch, easily communicating where the nearest restrooms are, safety, etc. Define the focal points (e.g. stage, food table, nametag table, merch table, restrooms etc.)

### Operations

1 local person is sufficient for smaller events with our remote support (under 15 guests e.g. builder groups). 2 people (1 local main host and 1 co-host) are optimal for larger events (<100 guests, with some support from the venue or the targeted core guest cohort members).

### Run of show (RoS)

Have a brief schedule of items with posted start and end times, hard out times, owners and cues to transition between items. Here is an example:

| Time     | Duration | Item                             | Cue                                          | Owner | Hard out | Notes | \*HogPulse\* |

`*HogPulse* is a suggestion for a live feedback web app to collect valuable information during the event and orchestrate runtime decisions.`

### Budget

Specify a budget (food is often the most expensive item, event space booking fees, etc.)

## Delivery

### Day of

Send email blast via Luma app expecting guests.

### Merch distribution

Ensure merch is fairly distributed e.g. if more guests than merch, come up with a way to distribute it fairly (e.g. ask guests to share use cases, provide feedback in HogPulse, raffle etc.)

### Use HogPulse

Use HogPulse as a survey and analytics tool for live feedback from our events. This includes proper reference to Q&A during workshops and fireside chats, guest stats, and runtime decisions during the event (e.g. merch distribution, icebreaker participation etc). Can be used to follow-up or request deeper feedback.
Ask if they'd like to be invited to future events (core guest cohort).

### Contingencies

Things happen e.g. customs can delay merch deliveries, a speaker may cancel last minute, etc. Have a plan for these scenarios, e.g. pick locations where a backup speaker (staff member) would be available.

## Evals

Collect info from Luma and HogPulse. Create an evaluation matrix to rank the event relative to goals/intention/hypothesis set when planning the event, e.g.

### Matrix

| Attendees | Signups | Feedback Submissions | HogPulse Submissions | Venue Cost | Food Cost | Merch Cost | Budget Allocated | Impressions across socials |
| --------- | ------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
|           |         |                      |                      |            |           |            |                  |                            |

### Write-up

A brief paragraph of what happened at the event, key insights, etc. This will be shared with the rest of the company. Include a few photos from the event.

## Follow-up

Focus on building long-term relationships with participants, venue etc.
Send thank you for attending personally to the targeted guest cohort. Send a Luma email blast to thank all attendees and encourage further feedback by requesting a response to the email blast. Post to summary to socials.
